# Contributing to Lazygit

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's everything you need to know.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Follow the How to run guide to set up locally
3. Create a branch from `main` for your changes

## Branch Naming

Use a short, descriptive name prefixed by the type of change:

- `feat/context-popup`
- `fix/build-script-path`
- `docs/contributing-guide`

## Commit Convention

This project follows a simple commit convention:

| Prefix | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `style:` | Formatting, no logic change |
| `refactor:` | Code change that isn't a fix or feature |
| `chore:` | Build process, dependencies, configs |

## Opening a Pull Request

- PRs should target the `main` branch
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Describe **what** you changed and **why**
- If your PR is a work in progress, open it as a **Draft**

## Issues

You don't need an issue to open a PR, but feel free to open one if you want to discuss an idea before implementing it.

## How to run (contributors)

2. `chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh`
3. Drop your PDFs in `./books`
